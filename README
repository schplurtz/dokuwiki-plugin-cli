cli Plugin for DokuWiki

This plugin brings a Command Line Interface formatter to Dokuwiki allowing you to format the output of a transcript say for a user manual or on-line tutorial. It is designed to work with the output of a standard Unix Bash Shell, but should be suitable to document other kinds of CLI interaction, e.g. Windows Command Window, Python and Ruby, Matlab, etc.


All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:cli

Development, bug report, feature request happen at
https://github.com/schplurtz/dokuwiki-plugin-cli

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/cli/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!
